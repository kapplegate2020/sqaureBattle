This is a functioning, though not completed, online 2-player turn-based strategy game.
It is built with mongoDB to hold usernames and passwords.
It uses node.js to run the server and manage connections.
It uses socket.io to communicate messages from the user to the server, and to other users.

It still has many functionalities that are still in progress:
-updating the GUI to be easier to use
-adding animations
-making the game data more secure and less hackable
-QA testing to ensure stability in gameplay
-more stability in timekeeping code
